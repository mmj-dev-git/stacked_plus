# Stacked_plus [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A Flutter project built on the [Stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) framework ‚Äî a powerful architecture solution for production-ready applications.

Stacked provides amazing solutions for dependency injection, state management, routing, and more. However, there are some must-have libraries that are incredibly handy in development and ones we use daily when building high-quality apps.

**Stacked_plus** includes these core libraries so you can get started building your next app quickly, without wasting time on setting up the base project structure.

More details about Stacked can be found here: [Stacked Documentation](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/docs/getting-started/overview)
